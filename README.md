## Installation Instructions

If you would like to suggest code for **Shareable**, feel free. This project includes all the files you will need, including a package.json. Be certain to fork and clone both the frontend and the backend.  In your terminal, enter npm i (for both) to install the dev dependencies you will need locally. You're ready to go!

1. Fork our repo (https://github.com/eighthnote).
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b branchname).
3. Commit your changes (git commit -m "add some changes").
4. Push to the branch (git push origin branchname).
5. Create a new Pull Request.

(In the future, we hope to add a Plans route, which will include the ability to make a plan with your friend from their profile page, take you to a calendar to schedule the event, then notify your friend of the pending arrangement. Much of that will depend on what life throws at us after this class is complete!)
